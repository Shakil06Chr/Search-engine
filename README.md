Triple Search Engine: TDM, TF-IDF, and LSI

Overview

This project implements a search engine using three different text-processing techniques:

Term-Document Matrix (TDM)

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)

The search engine processes a dataset, cleans the text, and allows users to perform searches using these three methods. It then identifies common and uncommon documents among the search results.

Features

Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation and digit removal)

Term-Document Matrix (TDM) calculation

TF-IDF vectorization

Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Query-based document ranking for TDM, TF-IDF, and LSI

Identification of common and uncommon documents among the three techniques

Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter for interactive searches
